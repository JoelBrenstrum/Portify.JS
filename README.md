### Notes

Portify.JS runs in the Chrome browser. Others might work, but I'm recommending chrome currently

The script will start by pulling in the data from Spotify, it will then create the playlist(s) and begin populating them with tracks.

This will occur real-time, do not interrupt the process. The process can take a while. A 100 track playlist took me 85 seconds, so it takes around a second a song.

This script is EXPERIMENTAL! I had some recent success with it though and wanted to put the concept out there. I will be working to improve the script as time goes on.
