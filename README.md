# Portify.JS

Transfer all of your spotify playlists to google play without downloading anything at all!

Runs in your browser independant of your operating system.

### Instructions

1. Copy portify.js to your clipboard from  **[< HERE >](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordam/Portify.JS/master/portify.js)**. Copy it just like regular text.

2. Open https://play.google.com/music/listen in its own window in chrome

3. Press Ctrl-Shift-J to open the javascript console. 

4. Paste in portify.js and hit enter. 

5. Follow the instructions on the screen.

The script will start by pulling in the data from spotify, it will then create all of your playlists and begin populating them with tracks.

This will occour realtime, do not inturrupt the process. This process can take a LONG time! It depends on the number of songs, but do not run this if you will need to disconnect your computer from the internet anytime remotely soon.

This script is EXPERIMENTAL! I had some recent success with it though and wanted to put the concept out there. I will be working to improve the script as time goes on.
