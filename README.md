# Portify.JS

Transfer spotify playlists to google play without downloading anything at all!

Runs in your browser independent of your operating system. 

Lets you transfer all of your playlists, some of your playlists, or any public spotify playlist into google play. Your pick!

Setup is fast, go from reading this sentence to importing music in less then 60 seconds.

### Instructions

1. Drag the big <code>Portify.JS</code> link from [< THIS PAGE >](https://rawgit.com/jordam/Portify.JS/master/helper.html) to your bookmarks.

2. Open https://play.google.com/music/listen in its own window in chrome.

3. Click <code>Portify.JS</code> in on your bookmarks bar

You might need to press CTRL-SHIFT-B to pop open your bookmarks bar if its hidden.

The script will start by pulling in the data from spotify, it will then create all of your playlists and begin populating them with tracks.

This will occur real-time, do not interrupt the process. This process can take a LONG time! It depends on the number of songs, but do not run this if you will need to disconnect your computer from the internet anytime remotely soon.

This script is EXPERIMENTAL! I had some recent success with it though and wanted to put the concept out there. I will be working to improve the script as time goes on.
